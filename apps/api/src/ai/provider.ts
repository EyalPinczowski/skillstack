/**
 * The AIProvider seam (spec 12.3, ADR 004 and 012) and the shared AI types.
 *
 * A provider is one file that turns a `SafeAIRequest` (already redacted, see `safe-request.ts`)
 * into text. It never decides budgets, fallbacks or caching; the gateway does (`gateway.ts`).
 *
 * Rules for every provider implementation:
 * - plain `fetch` with the `signal` it is given, no SDK;
 * - the key goes in a header, never in a URL, a log line or an error message;
 * - on failure throw `ProviderQuotaError` (the provider's limit was reached) or
 *   `ProviderUnavailableError` (anything else). Never put the provider's own error text in
 *   either: it can echo the request, the key or the account.
